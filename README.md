The dataset provides information on water quality and sewage system conditions across various locations in USA. With over 40,000 entries, it includes key indicators, such as nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the water, which are important for assessing overall water quality. Each sample’s exact location is recorded using geographical coordinates, making it possible to study patterns based on region. Also, the sampling dates allow us to observe changes over time, helping us understand how nutrient levels and sewage system conditions vary across seasons or years.

The dataset also categorizes the state of the sewage systems, with labels like “Good” and “Moderate.” This data can help analyze how the condition of sewage systems might affect nutrient levels in the water, giving insight into potential sources of pollution. This information is valuable for managing environmental resources, especially in areas vulnerable to nutrient pollution and related issues. Overall, the dataset offers broad opportunities for analysis in fields like environmental science, public health, and urban planning, as it connects water quality indicators with infrastructure conditions across both time and location.
